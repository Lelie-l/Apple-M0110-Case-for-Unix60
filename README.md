# Apple-M0110-Case-for-Unix60
Magnet-held M0110-style case for a Unix60. This is a magnet-held case, with the gasket mount from the original Unix60 preserved. 

**Components needed:**
- 4mm (diameter) 2mm (depth) neodymium magnet. **(8x)**
- 20x10x2mm neodymium magnet. **(4x)**

Free to use. Can be used for commercial uses, I don't care.

.STEP files provided if you want to modify the case for a screw-full design.

Made in F360, might be diagnostically useful in case you encounter a problem.
