# Apple-M0110-Case-for-Unix60
Magnet-held M0110-style case for a Unix60. This is a magnet-held case, with an added support for a gasket mount.

**Components needed:**
- 4mm (diameter) 2mm (depth) neodymium magnet. **(8x)**
- 20x10x2mm neodymium magnet. **(4x)**
- 40x5x2mm gasket strips. **(12x)**

Free to use. Can be used for commercial uses, I don't care.

.STEP files provided if you want to modify the case for a screw-full design.

Made in F360, might be diagnostically useful in case you encounter a problem.

Any problems or questions, please contact Leliel#5659 on Discord. AMA! I can provide you with any project files given that you're willing to wait.

**STILL UNTESTED**
